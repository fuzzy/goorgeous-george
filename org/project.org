* [0/8] [#P] Saltstack Project                              :saltstack:infra:

The Saltstack infrastructure for T.H.W.A.P. consists of three environments: devel, test, and prod. There are three different Docker
swarms, one for each of these environments. Devel consists of arm32 nodes, many cores, not a lot of ram. Test consists of arm64 nodes,
double the ram, about half the cores as arm32. Prod consists of amd64 boxen, lotta ram, lotta cores...well enough.

* [/] [#P] G.O.A.T. Project                                      :goat:devel:

The Garden and Outdoor Automation Toolkit is a suite of tools to facilitate information gathering about an agricultural setup, and
optionally integrations for various bits of hardware for the purpose of control automation. Good stuff.

* [2/3] [#P] Goorgeous George                                  :george:devel:

GoOrgEous George is a http server, that renders ORG files to HTML on the fly. The rendering isn't quite perfect, but there will be
fixes incoming. I plan on using this in production to host my blogs if I can get the export quality up to par with ox-publish.
